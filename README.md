Real-Time text-to-braille convertor
Globally, 43 million people are blind while 295 million people have moderate to severe vision impairment. The technology for the visually impaired to perceive text (paper-embossed braille, audiobooks, braille printers) is heavy and expensive, not real-time, available for limited content, or ignores the spatial aspect of text required for subjects like Mathematics and science. 
Our team created IKSHANA, a real-time text-to-braille convertor. It can scan text from physical sources like a newspaper, postcard, or phone and instantly generate braille. 
Our project consists of 2 parts: the scanner, and the refreshable braille device (RBD). Through our custom OCR system and camera module (8 MP for clear imaging), the scanner first scans external text into a digital form. The microprocessor converts digital text into a form understandable by the RBD using our novel translation algorithm. Our RBD is composed of a matrix of solenoids with custom-printed shafts for optimum tactile acuity. The RBD displays the braille characters in rapid succession.
Key innovations by our team include-
1.	development of a novel translation algorithm 
2.	development of an RBD
3.	IKSHANA works in real-time and doesnâ€™t require pre-entered digital text
4.	Portable and sleek Design 
Our current project has been created as a proof of concept for one character in English. Our final design consists of a keyboard-like matrix of characters with multiple rows and columns that refresh after the user is at the last character of the matrix. Future iterations also include functionality for handwritten text and other languages and reduced size.
